## Setup

Colonel Kurtz is built using tools written for
[nodejs](http://nodejs.org). We recommend installing Node with
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

At the time of writing, Colonel Kurtz is built (and tested) with Node
0.10.0. It will remain at that version until a higher level of build tool
support for 0.12.0 can be obtained.

Dependencies are managed with an [`npm`](npmjs.org) `package.json`
file. You can install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

A production build can be built by running:

```bash
npm run prepublish
```

However most of the time developing with Colonel Kurtz, you will want
to reference the example app:

```bash
npm start
```

This will host the demo at `http://localhost:8080`. Running this
command takes care of recompiling JavaScript and Sass dependencies for
the example.

## Testing

Colonel Kurtz uses [Karma](karma-runner.github.io). You can run tests
with:

```bash
npm test
```

For faster builds, consider removing code coverage:

```bash
NO_COVERAGE=true npm test
```

## Publishing to NPM

This project publishes to npm using:

```shell
npm run release
```

This will run a shell script found at `./scripts/release`. It is
critically important not to simply run `npm publish`. The release
script sets up an expected structure for hosting on `npm`.

## Conventions

**Master is not safe**, use NPM for the latest stable version.

### Javascript

Colonel Kurtz uses ES6 Javascript (compiled using
[Babel](babeljs.io)). As for style, shoot for:

* No semicolons
* Commas last,
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer ' over "
* 80 character line length

### Style (Sass)

We use the `scss` syntax for Sass. We also have a couple of opinions:

* Multiple selectors are placed on multiple lines
* Alphabetize rules
* Limit nesting
* All variables must use the `!default` flag
* All variables must be prefixed with `$col`
* All selectors, as possible, must be prefixed with `.col`

### Testing

Additionally, we aspire for 100% code coverage. However 100% code
coverage is not a foolproof indicator of good testing. Tests that
cover as much surface area as possible (for the sake of coverage)
should be avoided. This is a much softer measure than a style guide,
and will fall to code review for enforcement.

### Reviews

All changes should be submitted through pull request. Ideally, at
least two :+1:s should be given before a pull request is merge.
